    * some back-pressure by slowing down client requests)
    *
    * - the pool that handles the connections to your DB, thus
    * back-pressuring your DB server.

    * As a side-note, you probably want your HTTP pool to be
    * smaller than your DB pool (since you might be doing multiple
    * DB calls per request).

    *   The maximum number of threads in the pool. Always defaults to 1 thread,
    *   if you accidentally give it a value < 1.
