  /** The difference between this one and ExecutionContextMainFT is that this one allows to us to have a fixed thread
    * pool with 1 thread.
    *
    * N.B.: places where it is advisable to have a fixed thread pool:
    *   - the pool that handles incoming HTTP requests (thus providing some back-pressure by slowing down client
    *     requests)
    *
    *   - the pool that handles the connections to your DB, thus back-pressuring your DB server.
    *
    * As a side-note, you probably want your HTTP pool to be smaller than your DB pool (since you might be doing
    * multiple DB calls per request).
    *
    * @param threadNamePrefix
    *   prefixes this name to the ThreadID. This is the name that usually shows up in the logs. It also prefixes the
    *   maxThread count.
    * @param maxThreads
    *   The maximum number of threads in the pool. Always defaults to 1 thread, if you accidentally give it a value < 1.
    * @param daemons
    *   whether or not the threads in the pool should be daemons or not. see java.lang.Thread#setDaemon(boolean) for the
    *   meaning for daemon threads.
